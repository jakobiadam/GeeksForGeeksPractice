Medium Accuracy: 51.71% Submissions: 149 Points: 4

You are given an equation of the form x1+x2+...+xN=K. You need to find the total number of positive integral solutions of this equation.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = a+b=5
Output: 4
Explanation: (4,1) , (1,4) , (2,3) , (3,2)

Example 2:

Input: s = a+b=1
Output: 0
Explanation: No solution exist.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function posIntSol() which takes a string as input and returns number of solutions.
 

Expected Time Complexity : O(Length of given string)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= K <= 25
2 <= N <= 10
